                        Each team is made up of up to four secondary school students, and two team leaders. Team members need 
                        to cover only those expenses related to traveling to and from the competition venue. All local expenses, 
                        deriving from the general regulation are covered by the organizers. Accompanying persons and observers 
                        are welcome, but they should pay for their stay. Interested people in attending the event are advised to 
                        contact local organizers.<br><br>
                        The official language is English. Students may use their native language. Programming problems will be 
                        formulated in English and then translated by the team leaders into the native language of their team. Both 
                        versions will be given to students. Team leaders must be able to speak and write in English, as well as the 
                        language of their team.<br><br>
                        The computers will be IBM PCs compatible with selected software packages. Only the computers and 
                        software with built-in help facilities provided by the organizers may be used during the competition. The 
                        use of digital, printed, sound and other materials will be forbidden. The programming languages of the 
                        contest are C and C++. The compilers and programming environments for the above mentioned 
                        programming languages will be installed on the hard disk.

                        The General Assembly is made up of the team leaders of the participating teams and the president, 
                        nominated by the host country. The General Assembly selects problems to be solved in the competition 
                        from a set of problems prepared and proposed by the Scientific Committee.<br><br>
                        The selection procedure is as follows:<br><br>
                        The chairperson of the Scientific Committee distributes the proposals. Their number equals the number 
                        of problems to be solved by the contestants.<br><br>
                        The GA members may either accept or, in case of a major ambiguity of formulation or other serious 
                        reasons, deny the proposals by voting. When and if a proposal is denied, another prepared proposal will 
                        be offered to the GA. For such cases, the Scientific Committee should prepare at least two extra proposals 
                        for each round. The text of the accepted proposals must not be changed by the GA, except for minor 
                        rephrasing that is needed to avoid smaller ambiguities.<br><br>
                        The selected problems will be translated by the team leaders into the national languages of the teams.

                        requested languages will be provided in the same envelope along with the English version.<br><br>
                        In addition, each contestant will have online access to the official English version of tasks and all task 
                        translations in electronic format (PDF).<br><br>
                        The number and kind of files that the contestant must submit as a solution (for example, "source code of 
                        the program in a text file") will be specified in the task statement.<br><br>
                        Direct access to any file, excluding standard input and standard output, is forbidden. In some tasks reading 
                        from file and writing in file this could be not necessary at all because data will be exchanged through the 
                        interfaces specified in the task statement.<br><br>
                        Each task will be checked on set of single test cases or/and groups of test cases with specific properties 
                        (subtasks), each worth a fraction of the total points. Points for subtask will be assigned only when all test 
                        cases of the subtask are solved.<br><br>
                        Time limit for a single test case and memory limit will be specified for every task. When few tests are 
                        grouped in a subtask then time limit is applied for each test case in the group separately. The memory 
                        limit is on the overall memory usage including executable code size, stack, etc. In general, time and 
                        memory limits will be generous.<br><br>
                        All necessary files regarding the statement of a task as well as electronic documentation or reference 
                        manuals will be provided through the grading system.

                        The contestants’ submissions are evaluated by a contest system. The contest system consists of a contest 
                        server. The contestants will be able to run their solutions on the server using the test facility
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                ● Contestants submit solutions to the contest server via a web-based submission system running 
                                on that server. Each contestant will be assigned a username and a password for accessing the 
                                web application on the contest server.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                ● Submissions are evaluated on the server
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                ● The submission facility will accept C or C++ source files, verify that the program compiles and 
                                obeys the stated limits on program source size; the submission facility will then run the program 
                                on the task test cases (different from the ones given in the task description), enforcing the 
                                relevant run-time resource constraints, grade the solutions and report the results to the 
                                contestants.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                ● For each task full feedback will be enabled

                            <li>
                                ● A wait period of one minute will be enforced between submissions from the same contestant, 
                                for the same task
                            </li>

                        The solution must terminate its execution normally in order to be graded. If the solution returns an error 
                        code different from zero, the contest system will consider that the solution had a runtime error and no 
                        points will be awarded for the corresponding test case. Therefore, solutions in C or C++ have to define 
                        the main function as ‘int main’ and terminate the execution with ‘return 0’ or ‘exit(0)’.<br><br>
                        It is the responsibility of the contestants to submit their solutions to the contest system before the contest 
                        is finished. We advise the contestants to make sure they have enough time before the end of the contest 
                        so that all of their solutions are submitted.<br><br>
                        Contestants may use the test interface of the contest system to run their submitted solutions on test data 
                        of their choice.

                        For each task the test data will be divided into groups, with each group containing one or more test 
                        inputs. A test input is solved correctly if the submitted program produces a correct output file within the 
                        set limits. A group is solved correctly if each of the inputs it contains is solved correctly.<br><br>
                        Points are awarded only for correctly solved groups of inputs. If there are partial grading rules for the 
                        problem, then the score for an input group will be the lowest among the scores for the particular test
                        inputs contained in the group.

                        Any attempt to bring any other item into the competition room will be considered cheating. In particular,

                        Each contestant will have a pre-assigned workstation. The workstations have network access to the

                        Contestants should be in their seats at least 5 minutes prior to the start of the competition. Contestants 
                        must find their assigned computer, sit down, and wait for the competition to begin without touching 
                        anything (such as keyboards, mice, pen or paper).<br><br>
                        Contestants must submit their solutions for each task by using the grading system.
                        During the competition, contestants may submit written questions concerning any ambiguities or items 
                        needing clarification in the competition tasks. Questions and comments must be submitted through the 
                        grading system or on the provided Clarification Request Forms, expressed either in the contestant's 
                        native language or in English. If required, delegation leaders will translate their contestants' questions 
                        into English after they are submitted and before they are sent to the Scientific Committee. The Scientific 
                        Committee will respond to every question submitted by the contestants during the competition. Since 
                        this might take some time, contestants should continue working while waiting for the answer to their 
                        questions.<br><br>
                        Contestants should phrase their questions so that a yes/no answer will be meaningful.
                        Questions will be answered with one of the following without any translation (so the contestant have to 
                        know their meaning):
                        <ul>

                                ● "ANSWERED IN TASK DESCRIPTION (EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY)" - The task 
                                description contains sufficient information. The contestant should read it again carefully
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                ● "INVALID QUESTION" - The question is most likely not phrased so that a yes/no answer 
                                would be meaningful. The contestant is encouraged to rephrase the question.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                ● "NO COMMENT" - The contestant is asking for information that the Scientific Committee 
                                cannot give
                            </li>
                        </ul><br><br>
                        There is no restriction on the number of times a program may be edited, compiled, and run on the workstation.
                        Grading and evaluation take place on the grading system, which provides a same execution environment 
                        to that of the contestant workstation. Grading workstation will have the same hardware and software 
                        configuration as contestants' workstations (without programs for monitoring and the grading system).<br>
                        To avoid overloading the grading system, there are two restrictions on the number of submissions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                ● Contestants may submit a solution to each task at most once per 30 seconds. This restriction is 
                                removed in the last 15 minutes of the contest
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                ● Contestants may submit at most 100 solutions for each task
                            </li>
                        </ul><br><br>
                        Contestants can use the grading system to view the status of their submissions and get a short report on 
                        the compilation errors of their source code.<br>
                        The final score for each subtask will be the maximum score of this subtask across all submissions. The 
                        score for each task will be the sum of scores for its subtasks.<br>
                        If a subtask is not solved, then the grading system will give the feedback for the first input scenario, 
                        which was not solved correctly. The feedback will contain the input scenario number and the type of 
                        error.<br><br>
                        It should be noted that the score reported in the full feedback is only provisional. There are two ways 
                        how this score may change after it has been reported to the contestant:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                ● Due to a successful appeal after the contest.
                            </li>

                                ● In some cases, the contestants' submissions may be re-evaluated. This re-evaluation may 
                                sometimes lead to a different total score. (E.g., if a solution behaves nondeterministically or runs very 
                                close to the time or memory limit.) In such cases, the final score for the submission is the score for its 
                                latest re-evaluation. This change in scoring cannot be appealed. Note that the final score for each task is 
                                still the maximum score over all submissions.

                        and network problems. The only manner in which contestants are allowed to access the network is via 
                        the grading system: even running a single "ping" command is strictly prohibited and may lead to 
                        disqualification.<br>

                        Committee. Every appeal will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee and the Team Leader will be 
                        notified of the committee's decision. All appeals and their disposition will be summarized at the final

                        determined by an automatic procedure, based on the number of points the contestants achieved. The

                               1.   The score necessary to achieve a gold medal is the highest score so that at least one twelfth of

                             </li>

                                3.   The score necessary to achieve a bronze medal is the highest score so that at least one half of all
